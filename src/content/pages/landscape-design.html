    This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
    that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
    content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
    to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
    content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
    of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
    about making the content accessible and easy to read.

            <h2>What is Landscape Design? An Overview of Front Yard and Backyard Re-Design</h2>
            <p>Professional landscape design involves the systematic planning and arrangement of outdoor elements to maximize property functionality and aesthetic appeal. Our designers evaluate your property's specific characteristics, including soil composition, drainage patterns, and sun exposure, to develop practical solutions. The design process integrates your preferences with technical requirements to create outdoor spaces that meet both immediate needs and long-term objectives.</p>
