    This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
    that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
    content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
    to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
    content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
    of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
    about making the content accessible and easy to read.

            <h2>Our Complete Artificial Turf Services</h2>
            <h3>Custom Turf Design</h3>
            <p>
                We develop synthetic turf plans that match your property’s layout, usage needs, and aesthetic preferences. Our advanced design process accounts for foot traffic, drainage, and regional weather. We use 2D and 3D visualization to confirm the final look and ensure your new turf meets all practical and visual requirements.
            </p>
            <h3>New Turf Installation</h3>
            <p>
                From sub-base preparation to infill application, we follow strict guidelines to create a stable, even surface. Our installers work with various turf types—polyethylene, polypropylene, or nylon—to suit different climates and project goals. Proper seam placement and integrated drainage systems help your lawn remain durable and visually appealing.
            </p>
            <h3>Backyard and Patio Artificial Turf Installation</h3>
            <p>
                We begin by examining your backyard and patio, noting slopes, foot traffic needs, and drainage concerns. We then develop a plan that addresses these factors, ensuring a stable surface and proper water management. Our installation includes thorough site preparation, material placement, and finishing, leaving you with a clean, low-maintenance outdoor space.
            </p>
            <h3>Sports & Athletic Field Turf</h3>
            <p>
                We specialize in installing synthetic fields for soccer, football, and other athletic activities. Each field is engineered for player safety, consistent performance, and high durability. Features such as shock-absorbent underlayment and accurately painted lines provide an optimal playing surface that withstands heavy use.
            </p>
            <h3>Playground & Recreational Turf</h3>
            <p>
                Our playground turf includes cushioning layers to reduce impact and meet safety standards for fall protection. We use antimicrobial infill to minimize bacteria growth, keeping play areas cleaner. With proper drainage and secure fastening, the turf remains consistent, comfortable, and safe for children and families.
            </p>
            <h3>Putting Green & Golf Turf</h3>
            <p>
                We install custom putting greens that simulate natural course conditions, complete with realistic ball roll and consistent speed. Our designs account for slope, drainage, and surface quality to improve your short game. High-quality infill and base systems minimize maintenance while preserving performance over time.
            </p>
            <h3>Rooftop & Terrace Turf</h3>
            <p>
                We convert underused rooftops and terraces into lush green retreats using lightweight, high-drainage turf systems. Specialized backing and drainage mats protect roofing materials from moisture. This solution offers an urban oasis for relaxation and entertainment with minimal upkeep.
            </p>
            <h3>Pet-Friendly Artificial Grass for Dogs</h3>
            <p>
                Our pet turf systems include specialized drainage to manage liquids and prevent odors. We select durable fibers and infills that stand up to frequent paw traffic. The result is a comfortable, low-maintenance lawn that keeps your pets happy and your outdoor space clean.
            </p>
            <h3>Artificial Turf Repairs & Reinforcements</h3>
            <p>
                We address worn or damaged areas by re-seaming, replacing infill, or patching sections as needed. This approach restores both appearance and functionality without a full overhaul. Reinforcements help prolong the turf’s life, ensuring it continues to look and perform at its best.
            </p>
            <h3>Turf Maintenance Services</h3>
            <p>
                Our maintenance program includes regular brushing, infill leveling, and debris removal to preserve turf quality. We also offer sanitizing treatments that reduce bacteria and odors. These routine services help keep your synthetic grass clean, vibrant, and safe.
            </p>
            <h3>Turf Extensions & Modifications</h3>
            <p>
                When you need extra coverage or want to change your lawn’s layout, we seamlessly merge new turf with existing installations. We match turf type and color to create a unified appearance. Drainage and base adjustments may also be included to ensure longevity and performance.
            </p>
            <h3>Drainage & Base Preparation</h3>
            <p>
                Proper drainage and a stable foundation are crucial for long-lasting turf. We level and compact the subgrade, then lay a crushed rock or decomposed granite base to promote efficient water flow. This prevents issues like waterlogging, uneven surfaces, and shifting over time.
            </p>
            <h3>Artificial Turf Removal & Replacement</h3>
            <p>
                When your old turf needs updating, we handle removal, disposal, and reinstallation in one streamlined process. Our team assesses the existing base and drainage to address any underlying issues before installing modern, high-quality turf. This upgrade improves both the appearance and durability of your outdoor space.
            </p>
            <h3>Hardscaping Integration</h3>
            <p>
                We integrate artificial turf with patios, walkways, retaining walls, and other hardscapes to create a cohesive outdoor design. Our planning ensures smooth transitions between surfaces and complements your property’s overall layout. This holistic approach enhances both the functionality and visual appeal of your landscape.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Artificial Turf Installation Process</h2>
            <h3>Initial Consultation and Site Assessment</h3>
            <p>
                We begin by evaluating your property, taking measurements, and discussing how you plan to use your new turf. This step allows us to identify any special considerations—such as high foot traffic or pet-friendly needs—and develop a tailored installation plan.
            </p>
            <h3>Design and Material Selection</h3>
            <p>
                Next, we guide you through the selection of high-quality turf materials—such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or nylon—based on your budget, preferences, and usage requirements. We explain how each component works to create a durable, realistic, and low-maintenance lawn.
            </p>
            <h3>Site Preparation and Excavation</h3>
            <p>
                Proper preparation is vital for a stable, long-lasting artificial turf surface. We clear and level the area, removing debris and ensuring correct grading. Careful excavation helps create a solid base while minimizing disturbance to surrounding landscaping or structures.
            </p>
            <h3>Turf Installation</h3>
            <p>
                We install the chosen turf and any necessary underlayment, paying close attention to seaming, edge securing, and infill distribution. Proper compaction and drainage measures are taken at this stage to prevent water buildup and maintain a smooth, even surface.
            </p>
            <h3>Final Walkthrough and Maintenance Guidelines</h3>
            <p>
                After installation, we perform a thorough inspection to confirm everything meets our quality standards. We then provide tips for routine upkeep—such as brushing, rinsing, and debris removal—to help you keep your artificial turf looking fresh for years to come.
