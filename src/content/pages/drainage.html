    This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
    that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
    content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
    to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
    content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
    of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
    about making the content accessible and easy to read.

            <h2>Our Complete Drainage System Services</h2>
            <h3>Drainage Assessments and Design</h3>
            <p>
                A thorough assessment is the first step in resolving water-related issues. Our specialists review soil composition, grading, and water flow patterns. We then create a custom drainage plan that factors in local rainfall, Houston’s clay soils, and your landscape’s layout.
            </p>
            <h3>French Drain Installation</h3>
            <p>
                French drains offer a discreet way to redirect excess water away from foundations, gardens, and low areas. By installing a perforated pipe in a gravel-filled trench, we channel water away from problem spots. The proper slope is crucial for efficiency and helps prevent water accumulation near your home or business.
            </p>
            <h3>Channel and Trench Drains</h3>
            <p>
                Channel drains (also known as trench drains) work well around driveways, patios, and paved areas prone to pooling. We place these drains level with the surrounding surface to capture runoff before it seeps into unwanted zones. Protective grates keep debris out while allowing vehicles and pedestrians to move safely overhead.
            </p>
            <h3>Yard and Landscape Grading</h3>
            <p>
                Uneven terrain can worsen drainage problems by trapping water. Our landscape grading services adjust slopes to direct water toward appropriate drainage outlets. This approach prevents standing water and creates a smoother, more appealing yard or garden.
            </p>
            <h3>Downspout and Gutter Redirection</h3>
            <p>
                Rain gutters are your roof’s first defense against water damage, but simply depositing water at your foundation can cause flooding or erosion. We reroute downspouts via underground piping or splash blocks to channel water away from your home’s base, reducing the risk of water intrusion and foundation issues.
            </p>
            <h3>Sump Pump Installation</h3>
            <p>
                For properties vulnerable to water buildup—such as basements or low-lying structures—sump pumps add an extra layer of security. Installed in a dedicated sump pit, these pumps automatically remove accumulated water. We make sure each pump is properly sized and integrated with any existing drainage network.
            </p>
            <h3>Dry Well and Infiltration Systems</h3>
            <p>
                Dry wells manage roof and surface water by letting it soak into the surrounding soil instead of overburdening municipal drains. We design dry wells to match your property’s soil composition, allowing water to seep in without causing puddling or runoff.
            </p>
            <h3>Retrofitting Existing Systems</h3>
            <p>
                If you have an outdated or underperforming drainage setup, we can modify it for improved effectiveness. Retrofitting often involves upgrading pipes, adjusting grading, or adding new inlets to manage water more efficiently, particularly during severe Houston rainstorms.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Drainage Installation Process</h2>
            <h3>Initial Consultation and Site Assessment</h3>
            <p>
                We begin by inspecting your property, identifying problem areas and reviewing concerns such as wet basements or persistent standing water. We then create a tailored plan to resolve these issues.
            </p>
            <h3>Design and Material Selection</h3>
            <p>
                Our team chooses high-quality components—like perforated PVC pipe, channel drain grates, or geotextile fabrics—based on your budget and specific needs. We explain how each part works to divert water safely away from your home or business.
            </p>
            <h3>Site Preparation and Excavation</h3>
            <p>
                Proper installation is key to a drainage system’s longevity. We mark and excavate trenches or sump locations with minimal disruption to your property, taking care to avoid utilities, trees, and other structures.
            </p>
            <h3>Drainage System Installation</h3>
            <p>
                We install the chosen pipes, drains, and supplementary elements—such as catch basins or sump pumps—according to the design. Afterward, we backfill the trenches with suitable materials and re-grade the area to encourage runoff toward the system.
            </p>
            <h3>Final Walkthrough and Maintenance Guidelines</h3>
            <p>
                Our final inspection checks that everything is operating correctly. We then explain basic maintenance tasks, like removing debris from grates and monitoring sump pump performance, to keep your drainage system in top shape for years to come.

            <h2>The Importance of Flood Prevention Systems in Houston, TX</h2>
            <p>Houston’s heavy rainfall and clay-based soils create conditions where flooding can happen quickly, threatening both residential and commercial properties. Installing a reliable flood prevention system is crucial to avoid water damage, soil erosion, and potential foundation issues. When stormwater isn’t properly managed, it can lead to cracked walls, mold growth, and damage to landscaping—problems that become increasingly expensive to fix over time.</p>
